Idea:

Zillow Group has an internal social network that allows visability into the complex social relationships. You can see how people write about themselves, who is giving who karma (praise for doing a job well done, and specifically on what projects/work assignments) and what are your collegues' interests. I emulated this idea with all of the skills and knowledge aquired during my 15 week intensive full stack bootcamp at Flatiron school. 

To Install: 
```
1. bundle install

2. rails s - open to your preferred local host 

3. Check your path /api/users to ensure that your server is functioning properly. 
    If you see an array of objects you have set up the server correctly. 
    
4. the seed file should have username and password so you can login as if you were one of the users to explore

```
